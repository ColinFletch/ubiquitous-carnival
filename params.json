I'll certainly be checking out the following Documentation:\r\n\r\n>[using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\r\n\r\n### Project Guide\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @ColinFletch\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
